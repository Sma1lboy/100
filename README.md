Exploring the beauty of design, the shape of composition, and the realm of novelty - this is the artistic adventure I am pursuing for the next 100 days. In this electronic art project, I will immerse myself in the world of design, exploring the perfect balance between form and function. Each day, I will challenge myself to use different digital tools and techniques, which will result in the creation of unique and engaging visual works.
